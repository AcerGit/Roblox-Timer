# Roblox-Timer
A light, compact, multi-functional timer for roblox speedruns. 

Zone functionality:
It uses 2 "zones" which detect a 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 Part inside of your torso to determine when you have left the start zone and entered the finish zone.
It will then store your time to a dataservice that will remember your current record, even if you leave the server and rejoin. It will display the personal records of other people who may be in the server as well.

Track functionality:
There are two types of tracks included in this pack. They are referred to as either AA/AB tracks, or Straightaway/Checkpoint tracks. 
The difference is that one is from point A to point B and then your timer will stop.
The checkpoint track utilizes a checkpoint zone (you can add as many as you'd like) to tell they player that they need to pass through each of these before setting a time. You can also add a custom amount of required laps for this method, so that it can be used for racing games.

Installation:
Drag and drop the files where they need to go (they will be named accordingly to which folder they should be placed into Studio).
Tracks.rbxm should be placed directly into workspace.
